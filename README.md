# 2020_Software_Project_Valiuddin_Van_Roy: Home Monitor

Summary:

The idea was to design a web application on which users would be able to view temperature and humidity data from sensors placed around their house. Users could log in and create their own account using SSO authentication and then add the different sensors using their serial numbers. The website would also have additional functionality of displaying the city's weather using information from the OpenWeather API.

Firebase was used as the database to store user information and sensor data. React was used to create the frontend of the website.
