Front end javascript files.

App.js runs the main website and the pages folder contains the files for the home, login, signup and weatherAPI page.

The application uses Firebase Authentication to authenticate new users to the website and remembers their information. The aim is to connect user data to their account so that only they can access their data.

The project also includes a weather API which uses an OpenWeather subscription to get city weather.

The application can be run using node and running npm start when in the frontend folder.
